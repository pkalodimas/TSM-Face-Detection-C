  "tagline": "The implementation of a TSM Face Detection System in basic C",
  "body": "###Abstract\r\nThis page is referred to the custom implementation in basic C (for embedded systems) of a Tree Structure Model (TSM) face detection, pose estimation and landmark localization system based on the [“Face Detection, Pose Estimation, and Landmark Localization in the Wild”](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~xzhu/face/) system by [Xiangxin Zhu](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~xzhu/) and [Deva Ramanan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/). This implementation was developed by [Panos Kalodimas](https://gr.linkedin.com/in/pkalodimas) as its master thesis for the [Technical University of Crete](http://www.tuc.gr), Chania, Greece. More details about the master thesis can be found in the [master thesis web page](https://pkalodimas.github.io/Master-Thesis/).\r\n\r\n###Documentation\r\nAs this implementation is a part of a master thesis, the full documentation can be found in the [master thesis main page](https://pkalodimas.github.io/Master-Thesis/). The TSM system user manual can be found in the [documentation folder](https://github.com/pkalodimas/TSM-Face-Detection-C/tree/documentation/documentation).\r\n\r\n###Implementation\r\nThis implementation of the TSM face detection system is implemented in basic C. The default version is the 3.2 one. All the versions described in the master thesis documentation are available below. \r\n- [Version 1.3](https://github.com/pkalodimas/TSM-Face-Detection-C/archive/version-1.3.zip)\r\n- [Version 2.1](https://github.com/pkalodimas/TSM-Face-Detection-C/archive/version-2.1.zip)\r\n- [Version 2.2](https://github.com/pkalodimas/TSM-Face-Detection-C/archive/version-2.2.zip)\r\n- [Version 3.1](https://github.com/pkalodimas/TSM-Face-Detection-C/archive/version-3.1.zip)\r\n- [Version 3.2](https://github.com/pkalodimas/TSM-Face-Detection-C/archive/version-3.2.zip)\r\n- [Version 4.1](https://github.com/pkalodimas/TSM-Face-Detection-C/archive/version-4.1.zip)\r\n\r\nThere is also an object oriented version of the TSM system implemented in C++ that can be found [here](https://pkalodimas.github.io/TSM-Face-Detector-CPP/).\r\n",
